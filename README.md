# love_as_an_act
repository of a captive page developed for the workshop "Packing and Unpacking Care as a Framework for Building Collective Tools and Infrastructures" held by Meike Hardt

This <a href="https://maddagh.github.io/love_as_an_act/">html page</a> is a captive that was originally accessible only by connecting to an independent hotspot hidden in a vineyard somewhere in the netherlands' countryside.
The wifi was called "spores", many other hotspots, each one giving access to a captive, where hidden around the same space, all of the pages created where the result of a participant's personal reflections about shared readings and conversations on <i>All about love</i> by bell hooks and <i>The care manifesto</i>.

Love as an act, is the child of reflections and feelings bloomed from conversations with dear friends on what it means to love and be heartbroken, and the following passage of bell hooks text:

>To begin by always thinking of love as an action rather than a feeling is one way in which anyone using the word in this manner automatically assumes accountability and responsability. We are often taught we have no control ove our "feelings". Yet most of us accept that we choose our actions, that intention and will inform what we do. We also accept that our actions have consequences. To think of actions shaping feelings is one way we rid ourselves of conventionally accepted assumptions such as that parents love their childeren, or that one simply "falls" in love without exercising will or choice, that there are such things as "crimes of passion," i.e., he killed her because he loved her so much. If we were constantly remembering that love is as love does, we would not use the word in a manner that devalues and degrades its meaning. When we are loving we openly and honestly express care, affection, reponsability, respect, commitment, and trust.</q>
